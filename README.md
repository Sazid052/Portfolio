# Sazid Bin Sabbir's Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio repository! This space features my projects, primarily focused on environmental analysis using remote sensing data and geospatial techniques. Each project showcases a unique application of satellite-based data processing for climate and environmental studies.

## Projects

1. **MODIS Average LST vs Building Density**
   - **Link**: [MODIS-Average-LST-vs-Building-Density](https://github.com/Sazid052/MODIS-Average-LST-vs-Building-Density)
   - **Description**: An analysis of the relationship between land surface temperature (LST) and building density using MODIS data. The project explores urban heat patterns and their connection to built environments.

2. **MODIS LST March Mean UHII Timeseries**
   - **Link**: [MODIS-LST-March-mean-UHII-timeseries](https://github.com/Sazid052/MODIS-LST-March-mean-UHII-timeseries)
   - **Description**: A time series analysis of urban heat island intensity (UHII) using MODIS LST data for the month of March across several years. The project provides insights into temporal variations in urban heat patterns.

3. **Combined Mangrove Recognition Index (CMRI) in GEE**
   - **Link**: [Combined-Mangrove-Recognition-Index-CMRI-in-GEE](https://github.com/Sazid052/Combined-Mangrove-Recognition-Index-CMRI-in-GEE)
   - **Description**: Implementation of the Combined Mangrove Recognition Index (CMRI) using Google Earth Engine (GEE) to identify mangrove forests. The project highlights the use of NDVI and NDWI indices for effective mangrove area estimation.
