# Sazid Bin Sabbir's Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio repository! This space features my projects, primarily focused on environmental analysis using remote sensing data and geospatial techniques. Each project showcases a unique application of satellite-based data processing for climate and environmental studies.

## Projects

1. **MODIS Average LST vs Building Volume Analysis**
   - **Link**: [MODIS-Average-LST-vs-Building-Volume-Analysis](https://github.com/Sazid052/MODIS-Average-LST-vs-Building-Volume-Analysis)
   - **Description**: An analysis of the relationship between land surface temperature (LST) and building volume using MODIS and GHSL data. The project investigates how urban development influences nighttime heat patterns and performs correlation analysis.

2. **MODIS LST March Mean UHII Timeseries**
   - **Link**: [MODIS-LST-March-mean-UHII-timeseries](https://github.com/Sazid052/MODIS-LST-March-mean-UHII-timeseries)
   - **Description**: A time series analysis of urban heat island intensity (UHII) using MODIS LST data for the month of March across several years. The project provides insights into temporal variations in urban heat patterns.

3. **Combined Mangrove Recognition Index (CMRI) in GEE**
   - **Link**: [Combined-Mangrove-Recognition-Index-CMRI-in-GEE](https://github.com/Sazid052/Combined-Mangrove-Recognition-Index-CMRI-in-GEE)
   - **Description**: Implementation of the Combined Mangrove Recognition Index (CMRI) using Google Earth Engine (GEE) to identify mangrove forests. The project highlights the use of NDVI and NDWI indices for effective mangrove area estimation.

4. **Excel VBA Multi-Plot Chart Generator for River Cross Section**
   - **Link**: [Excel-VBA-Multi-Plot-Chart-Generator-for-River-Cross-Section](https://github.com/Sazid052/Excel-VBA-Multi-Plot-Chart-Generator-for-River-Cross-Section)
   - **Description**: A VBA-based tool for generating multiple plots of river cross-section data in Excel. This project streamlines the visualization process for hydraulic studies, allowing efficient plotting and comparison of cross-sectional data.

5. **GCM Data Analysis using Python**
   - **Link**: [GCM-Data-Analysis-using-Python](https://github.com/Sazid052/GCM-Data-Analysis-using-Python)
   - **Description**: An analysis of General Circulation Model (GCM) outputs using Python. The project focuses on extracting and visualizing climate model data, performing trend analysis, and assessing future climate scenarios based on CMIP data.
